### Artistic Statement

For this project, I wanted to stay with a science-fiction theme inspired by the "Dune" series by Frank Herbert, but in a style inspired by "The Starry Night" by Van Gogh. I wanted to use the images to create a science-fiction story of a new liberated kingdom on a unique planet. I wanted the symbol of liberation to be the iconic night sky from the painting with the rolling stars and effects. To seem as if the universe of this story was located within the waves of the starry night. As for the kingdom and the environments within, I wanted to keep to a science-fiction theme of keeping thing futuristic with shiny colors of white and tall pointed structures and modern technologies, such as spaceships and high-speed trains. I wanted each image to be different from the last and be focused on a new individual aspect of the world. Such as the mountainside, the desert, ship ports, and the towns themselves. I wanted to focus on the citizens of the kingdom but there were some restrictions with some of the prompts I was trying to use. I tried to use unique styles and lighting effects depending on the situation being depicted and used different artistic techniques to make each image different. I feel overall it helped to present the unique world of this futuristic kingdom within the seas of the starry night.

### Methodology Statement

I wanted to generate images that were inspired by 2 of my favorite and most recent interests. For most of my life, I have been a fan of the work of Van Gogh. I have constantly used his work as reference for most of my AI-generation assignments. My favorite piece by Van Gogh is "The Starry Night" and I wanted to utilize its nighttime theming for this project. Another big, but recent, inspiration I have had comes from the "Dune" series by Frank Herbert. I have read and been a fan of the dune books for some time and have recently watched Dune (Part One) and Dune (Part Two) in theaters and my interest in science-fiction has definitely been reignited. So, I wanted to create images in the realm of science-fiction but in the style of Van Gogh's iconic painting. I looked into the image generation tools recommended on the assignment page, but from experience, I know that the best tool to use would be Adobe Firefly, as it has many options and tools for many types of generation.
